Video Games Sales Prediction

Overview :
This project aims to predict video game sales based on various features like Rank, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, and regional sales. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately forecast sales figures, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

Dataset :
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:

Rank: The ranking of the video game.
Platform: The platform on which the game is released.
Year: The release year of the game.
Genre: The genre of the video game.
Publisher: The publisher of the video game.
Regional Sales: Sales figures for different regions.

Feature Engineering :
To improve the performance of the machine learning model, the following feature engineering steps were performed:

Handling Missing Values: Strategies to deal with missing values in the dataset.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Conversion of categorical features into numerical format using techniques like label encoding.

Modeling :
The project explores machine learning algorithm to predict video game sales that is :
Linear Regression

Evaluation :
Model performance is evaluated using various metrics, including:
R-squared
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
